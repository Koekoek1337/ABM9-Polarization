The Fermi Equation

The Fermi equation for the probability pijpij​ of forming or breaking a connection between agent ii and agent jj is typically formulated as:

pij=11+exp⁡(α⋅(∣oi−oj∣−β))pij​=1+exp(α⋅(∣oi​−oj​∣−β))1​

Where:

    oioi​ and ojoj​ are the opinions of agent ii and agent jj, respectively.
    αα is a parameter that controls the sensitivity of the probability to the difference in opinions.
    ββ is a threshold parameter that shifts the curve along the x-axis, determining the base level of tolerance for opinion differences.

How αα and ββ Affect the Probability
αα (Sensitivity Parameter)

    High αα Value:
        When αα is large, the function becomes steeper. This means that even small differences in opinions ∣oi−oj∣∣oi​−oj​∣ can result in a significant change in the probability pijpij​.
        High αα values indicate low tolerance for opinion differences. Small differences in opinion lead to a rapid decrease in the probability of forming a connection.

    Low αα Value:
        When αα is small, the function is more gradual. This means that larger differences in opinions are needed to significantly affect the probability pijpij​.
        Low αα values indicate high tolerance for opinion differences. The probability of forming a connection decreases more slowly as the opinion difference increases.

ββ (Threshold Parameter)

    High ββ Value:
        A high ββ shifts the curve to the right, meaning that the agents are more tolerant of opinion differences before the probability pijpij​ starts to decrease significantly.
        With a high ββ, larger opinion differences are tolerated, and the probability of forming a connection remains relatively high even for agents with different opinions.

    Low ββ Value:
        A low ββ shifts the curve to the left, meaning that even small opinion differences result in a decrease in the probability pijpij​.
        With a low ββ, smaller opinion differences are tolerated, and the probability of forming a connection decreases more rapidly as the opinion difference increases.

Interpretation in Social Contexts

    αα affects how sharply opinion differences influence social connections. Higher sensitivity means that individuals are less likely to connect with those who have different opinions, leading to more homogeneous social groups.
    ββ sets the base level of tolerance. A higher threshold means individuals are generally more tolerant of differences, promoting more diverse social connections.
