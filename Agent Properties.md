#### Opinion (float):
Value in the range $[op_a, op_b]$ that represents the degree an agent agrees with stance a and b. Changes over the course of the simulation through random fluctuation and agent interaction.

#### Conformity (float):
Value in range $[0, 1]$ that represents the degree an agent copies the opinion of it's neighbors.

#### Tolerance (float):
Value in range $[0,1]$ that affects how likely an agent is of maintaining it's connection to an agent with conflicting opinion.

#### Degree (int):
The target amount of edges an agent aims to maintain.
