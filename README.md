Welcome to the repo of ABM group 9. 

The markdown files presented are specifically optimized for use with Obsidian (https://obsidian.md), but should otherwise be readable in any other markdown application.

[[Key concepts]] lays some of the ground work for the design of our model. More concise definitions are given in [[Agent Behavior]] and [[Agent Properties]].

Thus far, not much has been planned for the system analysis part of the model. However, feel free to add to it in [[System Properties]].

Finally, an itemized list for our project objectives is presented in [[TODO list]]
